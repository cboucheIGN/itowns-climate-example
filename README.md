# NetCDF and web visualization

This following projet show you the processus to make a web base visualization of your NetCDF temperature info.

The processus would be the same to render other NetCDF feature as the wind.

## Example

See the example for [Paris](index.html)

## Process

1. Export the temperature dataset to a GeoJSON
    * see this [quick guide](doc/netcdf2geojson_qgis.md)
2. Create your Itowns scene
    * [Itowns](http://www.itowns-project.org/) documentation
    * [Source code](index.html) for Paris

Other project in IGN look for a direct integration of NetCDF data in Itowns. We will update this guide.
